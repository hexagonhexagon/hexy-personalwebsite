    <p>You might have noticed that I really like hexagons. Part of it is the fact that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY" title="Youtube - Hexagons are the Bestagons">hexagons are the bestagons</a>, what with hexagonal packing being the best way to pack spheres in 2 and 3 dimensions, and several other pleasant properties of hexagons, but part of it also has to do with the release of a certain game in 2012:</p>

    <p>I still think this is the perfect trailer. At the time, I was in high school, and child me was blown away by what I was seeing. I couldn't even fully interpret what was happening, I could just vaguely make out that someone was controlling that tiny triangle and somehow managing to not hit anything.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, I needed this game injected into my bloodstream immediately. Part of why I think this game left such an impression on me is the impeccable vibe and soundtrack, along with its minimalism. There's very little going on in the game: you move left or right, and you need to last 60 seconds or die trying. So all you have to carry you through beating your head against the wall is the music and the art style, and something about simple polygonal shapes and seeing the crazy patterns really does it for me.</p>

    <p>I ended up putting a lot of time into this game, like 30 hours or something silly like that, and I still have all the patterns and logic memorized. Thanks Terry Cavanagh (he made the game).</p>
